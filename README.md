# EndlessRunner-V4.0
EndlessRunner is the first Unity project i have made. Its a simple infinite runner type game where you control a red cylinder with swerve movements. This a touch only game.
Feel free to use the code as the world runs on give and take policy. 
**One important point** is if you by chance use the pause script , and if you go back to the menu using it and press play again, the game is in paused state only, please fix this.
****APK FILE INCLUDED, TRY THE GAME FOR YOURSELF, AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT IS FOR A FIRST PROJECT
